dalang-sublimetext2
===================

my personal sublime text2 setting

Linux
-----
* The setting file should be found in ~/.config/sublime-text-2/
* create shell script `/usr/bin/sublime` with the following:

  > \#! /bin/sh
  >
  > /opt/Sublime\ Text\ 2/sublime_text $1 &

    then you can use `sublime` to open Sublime text 2 in Terminal, and you can use `sublime filename` or `sublime folderpath` as well.
